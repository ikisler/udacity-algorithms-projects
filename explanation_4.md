### Reasoning
This algorithm concentrates on swapping the zeroes and the twos to the correct places, leaving the ones to stay in the middle -- this swapping action is a bit like a quicksort.

### Big-O
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), since we iterate over the input list just once.  The space complexity is O(1), since we do the entire operation in place in the given list..
