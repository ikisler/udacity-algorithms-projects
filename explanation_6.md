### Reasoning
Since we are just looking for the max and min values in the list, there's no need to actually do any sorting, so instead we just keep track of the largest and smallest value and compare every number in the list until we've got the smallest/largest.

### Big-O
Both time and space complexity is O(n), since we iterate over every single value in the list.
